# MRI-reconstruction-using-Resnet-with-data-consistency-layer
Here I implement Resnet with  data-consistency layer for MRI reconstruction using tensorflow 2.0 style

The basic code base is derived from https://github.com/gongenhao/GANCS

Particularly, I re-implement this interesting project using tensorflow-2.0 style
